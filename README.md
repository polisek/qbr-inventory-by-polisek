# QBR Inventory edited by Pol√≠sek

- Fixed saving ammo + saving to db
- Saves on every shot
- You can only have 1 Molotov or Dynamite and it will be deleted from your inventory when discarded.
- It is stored using the serial number. So if the player changes the position of the weapon in the inventory he still remembers it.

**If you need**
- Displays 5 slot in line ( screen ) 

- Just copy client/main.lua   
- Just copy server / main.lua

**If you need**
- Copy and paste html / css  /  main.css
